I am an undergraduate student studying Information Science with a focus in Data Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am on the path towards becoming a data analyst in in the world of research and medicine. To accomplish this goal, I have grown my experience with Python and a foundation in data science concepts including machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization. I am actively building my skills in SQL, Git/GitHub, and other tools commonly used in the data science workflow.

My goal is to contribute to the storage, organization, and analysis of data across medical institutions, such as pharmacies and hospitals, helping improve the efficiency and understanding of the information.


Some projects I have worked on are through a Data Science course I took at UIUC.
