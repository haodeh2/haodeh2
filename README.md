I am an undergraduate student studying Information Science with a focus in Data Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am on the path towards becoming a data analyst in in the world of research and medicine. To accomplish this goal, I have grown my experience with Python and a foundation in data science concepts including machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization. I am actively building my skills in SQL, Git/GitHub, and other tools commonly used in the data science workflow.

My goal is to contribute to the storage, organization, and analysis of data across medical institutions, such as pharmacies and hospitals, helping improve the efficiency and understanding of the information.

### Completed Projects

#### Mosaic🖼️

I created a mosaic of an image of my choice using thousands of tiny different images sharing an overall meaning behind the piece. 

This is the HD version, it allows you to zoom in and see all the tiny images that have been combined in order to create the larger mosaic.
